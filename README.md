# unit-testing dev branch
Challenge: Unit testing

Let's partice now!

Repository: unit-testing
Type of Challenge: Learning
Duration: 1 days
Deadline: 26/01/21 H:4:30PM
Team challenge : solo

Learning Objectives

You will learn how to take advantage of unit testing to create robust code. At the end of the challenge, you will be able to:

Test your code with the assert python keyword
Test your code with the unittest module
Test your code with pytest module
Use Mock objects
Use other features from pytest
The Mission
You work for a company working in Python. Your customer complains that your code crashes a lot and they're not able to access your services half of the time.

You see all the seniors of your company debugging all day and being mad at their colleagues breaking the code everytime they want to add a feature.

Your project manager asks you to write unit tests to fix the problem.

The code can be found under the unit-testing.py

The test_connect_to_db and test_add should work as asked. The mocking of the database is something which probably needs some future adjustments>

The  test_get_users_list_from_db is not working as it should be, an list of dicts called users has been created to simulate the database and be able to run the test.

The use of pytest has not been included as these gave errors, which I have not been able to resolve until this moment.
