The Mission
You work for a company working in Python. Your customer complains that your code crashes a lot and they're not able to access your services half of the time.

#You see all the seniors of your company debugging all day and being mad at their colleagues breaking the code everytime they want to add a feature.

Your project manager asks you to write unit tests to fix the problem.

The code can be found under the unit-testing.py
